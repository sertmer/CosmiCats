# Center for CosmiCats Research

## Description

CosmiCats is an application that allows true believers to click through 'hacked' files from nasa, searching for evidence that cats are indeed aliens.

CosmiCats is a React app that uses Redux as a global state management tool.
In creating this app, I focused on demonstrating mastery of the following:
* React
* Redux
* Router
* Asynchronous JavaScript
* Work within a short time frame (6 days) to deliver a unique product for my audience (people who believe cats are aliens)
